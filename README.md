**Reference:**

Data on New Zealand Vaccinations and Population by Area (District Health Board) from the [NZ Ministry of Health](https://www.health.govt.nz/).  

Following the visualisation design of [Marta Fioni](https://twitter.com/martafioni), as featured on the [UK government "equivalent" dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/).

**Summary**

This project seeks to boil down the many figures on vaccinations into an easily digested infographic. I've been looking for inspiration on this for quite a while - the key questions in my mind are:
- How many people are protected?
- How many to go?

The "waffle chart" visual chosen by Marta presents the vaccination data, standardised by the population of various Areas.  Areas of wildly differing populations (e.g. Auckland vs West Coast) can be easily compared.

The data is presented in an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography or Date), and includes supporting charts and data tables.  

The dataviz is refreshed (manually) every week, after the source data is updated. 

I have similar projects running for other countries:
 - [World](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/covid-19-world-vaccinations#readme) (select country, countries, continents or global summary)
 - [Australia](https://github.com/Mike-Honey/covid-19-au-vaccinations#readme) (select country, or State/Territory)
